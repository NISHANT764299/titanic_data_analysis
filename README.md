Titanic Data Analysis
This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to explore patterns and factors affecting passenger survival. The dataset contains information about passengers, such as their age, sex, ticket class, fare, and whether they survived the disaster.

Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization to identify trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.
Objectives:
Explore the dataset and clean it for analysis.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
Visualize relationships between different features (e.g., age, gender, ticket class) and survival rates.
